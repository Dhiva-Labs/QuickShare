"""Bridges GTK's GLib main loop and the core service's asyncio world.

NearShareService (and everything under nearshare.core) is asyncio-
native: the TCP receive server, mDNS advertiser/browser, and control
socket all run as coroutines on an event loop. GTK4/libadwaita instead
run their own loop (GLib's main context) on the thread that calls
`Adw.Application.run()`, and GTK widgets may only be touched from that
thread. The two loops don't share a thread, so this module is the one
place that crosses between them, in both directions:

  * UI thread -> asyncio thread: `AsyncioThread.run_coroutine()` uses
    `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe`, the one asyncio entry point
    documented safe to call from a different thread than the loop runs
    on. It returns a `concurrent.futures.Future`; if given `on_done`, that
    callback is scheduled back onto the GTK thread with `GLib.idle_add`
    once the coroutine completes, so UI code can update widgets safely.

  * asyncio thread -> UI thread: core callbacks (`Events.on_progress`,
    `service.on_peers_changed`, etc.) fire synchronously on the asyncio
    thread. Handlers must never touch a GTK widget directly from there;
    wrap the widget mutation in `idle(fn, *args)` (see app.py, where
    every `Events(...)` callback is a one-line lambda that does exactly
    that).

  * A third case, used only for `Events.on_transfer_request`: that
    callback is `async` and the core *awaits its result* on the asyncio
    thread (it needs the accept/decline boolean before continuing the
    handshake). But the accept/decline decision comes from a GTK dialog
    response, which fires on the UI thread. `bridge_future_to_asyncio`
    creates an `asyncio.Future` already bound to the right loop plus a
    thread-safe setter, so the UI thread can resolve a value the asyncio
    thread is `await`-ing.
