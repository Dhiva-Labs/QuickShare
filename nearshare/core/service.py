"""NearShareService: the headless core the GTK UI and CLI both drive.

Owns the TCP receive server, the mDNS advertiser (visibility on/off), the
mDNS browser (nearby peers), and outbound sends. Also serves a JSON-lines
control socket at $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/nearshare.sock so the `nearshare`
CLI can toggle visibility, query status, and start sends against the
running app:

    {"cmd": "status"}                      -> {"visible": true, ...}
    {"cmd": "on"} / {"cmd": "off"} / {"cmd": "toggle"}
    {"cmd": "peers"}                       -> {"peers": [...]}
    {"cmd": "send", "peer": "<instance>", "files": ["/path", ...]}
